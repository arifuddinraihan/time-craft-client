### Why And How (Tour of this Web-site)?

**1. Programming Hero (An online School of Programming world) has provided me an assignment to make an Reseller Website.**
 
**2. They Guided me through how the website should work.**
 
**3. First, I have Created an environment for this `Single Page Application` Website by using- npm-React.**
 
**4. Then I selected a theme from DaisyUI theme Generator, which is a Tailwind CSS based library.**
 
**5. For Hero Section in Homepage I have used `LottieFiles Player` which you can see in a link provided above.**
 
**6. By using Dynamic Route from `React Router` I have made this Application super-fast.**
 
**7. `React Hot Toast` is another beautiful React toast library used in this website, with this you can show next level notifications in your website- Alerts!**
 
**8. I have made this website super responsive by the Power of `TailwindCSS` Framework and `DaisyUI` library.**
 
**9. And `Context API` has made it easier for me to pass the data down to the deepest child element, super duper helpful.**

**10. On this project I have implemented `Google Firebase Authentication` this has made my website secure as I can monitor who has visited this website. Along with this website analytics can be used via this system.**

**11. For the courses and details, I have made some fake data and stored them in `Vercel`, a free platform for hosting entry level data**

**12. Then I have added a `React Environment Variable` to secure the API key which i got from Firebase**

**13. Created a `Vercel Configuration file` to set the route data file at vercel website.**

**14. Also I have added some conditional renders, Navbar user render, Email-Password wrong render.**

**15. `Private Route` is a system from where if your not a valid user, you can not access that particular page, has been applied in this project.**
